Data and code relative to the Selci et al. 2023 manuscript about the abundance and antimicrobial resistance of putative pathogens in the Costa Rica hot springs. Sequences are available through the NCBI SRA archive with accession numbers PRJNA579365 for the amplicon data, and PRJNA627197 for the shotgun metagenomes.

The repository contains the following files:

- README.md (this readme file)
- Selci_et_al_16SrRNA_analysis.r (the r code to reproduce the figures)
- pathogensCR_dataset.csv (the environmental dataset)
- a series of .csv files to replicate the figures and analyses reported in the paper
